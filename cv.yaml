about: |
  <p align='justify'>
  Hi, I am now a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong
  (<b>CUHK-CSE</b>) advised by Prof. \href{http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/}{Bei Yu}.
  My research interests include (1) <b>Machine Learning in VLSI Design for Manufacturability</b>, (2) <b>computer vision</b>.
  I did some work focusing on computational lithography and mask optimization.
  Now, I am also looking for academic visit or research interns.
  My open source contributions can be found on my \href{https://github.com/dekura}{github profile}.
  </p>
  <p align='justify'>
  I'm also maintaining a curated list of AI for EDA papers. Check it out here: \href{https://ai4eda.github.io}{Awesome AI for EDA}.
  The list is under construction and you are welcomed to submit your publications follow \href{https://ai4eda.github.io/about/}{the instructions}.
